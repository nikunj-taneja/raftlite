# raftlite
A pure Python implementation of Raft

This project is part of my effort to rediscover my passion for writing code.

The idea is to keep making at least one commit every day until a database can be built using the code in this project straight out-of-the-box.

The table below will serve as a log and help me track my progress. 

| Date | Highlight | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-05-27 | Setup the repo, start understanding Raft | This seems daunting and exciting at the same time |
| 2025-05-28 | Skimmed through the paper | Think I now have a basic understanding of the Raft algorithm |
| 2025-05-29 |  |  |


## TODO
- [x] Watch Raft lecture
- [ ] Read Raft paper
- [ ] Think about how to implement the RPCs in the simplest manner possible
- [ ] Implement the basic logic of a Raft node
- [ ] Think about how to do testing while developing to ease the debugging process
- [ ] Understand how elections work

## Notes to self

1. Stay consistent. Don't give up.
2. Break complex problems down into smaller, more digestible chunks.
