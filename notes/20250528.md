### Thoughts on testing:
- Maybe it's best to start with simple stuff like storing the state of a counter in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner.
- So, to start things off, the "state machine" will simply be a counter that accepts two types of commands: `increment` and `reset`. 
- Later on, we'll try to abstract this state machine to make it more generic and apply it to a real-world use case like a database. 
- Maybe a stepping stone like a system that can store balances of users and perform transactions will be a good idea, before trying to build a full-fledged distributed database.

### Open questions: 
- I need to be able to simulate server failures and recoveries for the testing. What's the simplest way to do this?
- Am I going to need a separate "cluster manager" class or should I simply run three servers and make each server have a reference to the other servers?
